    <h1>Approach to Software Development</h1>
    <p>
      This software development philosophy is rooted in pragmatism, continuous learning, and user-centered design. The goal is to deliver scalable, maintainable solutions that address real-world problems with efficiency and clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem First, Code Second</h2>
    <p>
      Effective development begins with a thorough understanding of the problem — including business objectives, user requirements, and technical constraints. Emphasis is placed on defining the “why” before determining the “how.”
    </p>

    <h2>Clean, Maintainable Code</h2>
    <p>
      Code quality is a priority. Readability, modular design, and simplicity are emphasized. Clean code practices are reinforced through peer reviews, consistent style guides, and appropriate tooling.
    </p>

    <h2>Agile & Iterative Development</h2>
    <p>
      The process embraces agile methodologies, with a focus on delivering value in small, frequent iterations. Feedback loops are built into each sprint, allowing teams to refine both product and process continuously.
    </p>

    <h2>Testing & Quality Assurance</h2>
    <p>
      Robust automated testing — including unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage — is integral to maintaining software quality. CI/CD pipelines support rapid, reliable delivery and early detection of issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Collaboration & Communication</h2>
    <p>
      Software development is treated as a collaborative effort. Open and proactive communication among developers, stakeholders, designers, and QA professionals ensures shared understanding and ownership.
    </p>

    <h2>Continuous Learning & Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      Staying current with evolving technologies and practices is considered essential. However, the approach remains grounded, favoring practical, context-driven decisions over trend-based development.
