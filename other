🌐 About This Portfolio
Welcome to my developer portfolio — a curated space where I showcase my journey, skills, and projects. I'm an aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for building meaningful, efficient, and user-focused software solutions.

This website reflects my growth in software development, from backend logic to frontend design. You'll find projects built with technologies like ASP.NET, SQL, MySQL, and new frameworks I'm currently exploring like NopCommerce.

Each section is designed to highlight:

🚀 Real-world projects with detailed case studies

🛠️ Technical skills and tools I’ve mastered

🧠 My mindset toward learning, growth, and impact
